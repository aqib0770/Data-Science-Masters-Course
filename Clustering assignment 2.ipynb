    "Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?\n",
    "<br>Ans: Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that groups ponts into a hierarchy of clusters. It works by by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on their similarity.\n",
    "<br>It does not require a pre-specified number of clusters like other clustering techniques such as k-means.\n",
    "<br>It produces a dendogram which can be used to visualize the hierarchical relationships between the clusters."

    "Q2. What are the two main types of hierarchical clustering algorithms? Describe each in brief.\n",
    "- **Agglomerative clustering:** Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster. It then iteratively merges the two most similar clusters until there is only one cluster remaining. The similarity between two clusters is typicallt measured using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance.\n",
    "- **Divisive clustering:** Divisive clustering starts with all data points in a single cluster. It then iteratively splits the largest into two smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one data point. The criterion for splitting a cluster is typically the dissimilarity between the most dissimilar data points in the cluster."

    "Q3. How do you determine the distance between two clusters in hierarchical clustering, and what are the common distance metrics used?\n",
    "<br>Ans: There are a number of different ways to determine the distance between two clusters in hierarchical clustering. The most common approach is to use distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. Other common distance metrics include Manhattan distance and correlation distance.\n",
    "<br>The distance between two clusters is typically calculated as the average distance between all pairs of data points in the two clusters. However, there are two ways to calculate the distance between clusters, sucg as using the distance between the cluster centroids or the minimum distance between any two points in the two clusters.\n",

    "Q4. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in hierarchical clustering, and what are some common methods used for this purpose?\n",
    "<br>Ans: There are a number of different ways to determine the optimal number of clusters in hierarchical clustering. Some common methods include:\n",
    "- Elbow method: The elbow method is a visual method that involves plotting the within- cluster sum of squares(WCSS) for different numbers of clusters. The WCSS is a measure of the distance between the data points in each cluster and the cluster centroid. The elbow point is the point where the WCSS starts to flatten out. This is typically taken to be the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "- Silhouette method: The silhoutte methos is a statistical method that measures the quality of clustering by assigning a silhoutte score to each data point. The silhoutte score is a measure of how well a data point is assigned to its cluster. The silhoutte score is calculated as the average distance between a data point and other data points in its cluster minus the average distance between a data point and the other data points in the next closest cluster. The optimal number of clusters is the number of clusters that maximizes the average silhouette score."

    "<br>They are useful in analyzing the results of hierarchical clustering in a number of ways:\n",

This can help you to identify the natural structure of the data and to identify groups of similar data points.\n",
