    "2. Inferential statistics:- It is used to make conclusion on the data that we have measured by using hypothesis and many other techniques. It is used when we want to conclude whether a product is good or bad"

    "1. Quantitative data: It is any numerical data. There are two types of numerical data, one is discrete and other is continuous data. A discrete data is any whole number and a continuous data is any positive integer.For example:\n",
    "No.of students is a discrete data and weight is a continuous data\n",
    "2. Qualitative data: It means categorical data where data can be divided. There are two types of categorical data, one is nominal and other is ordinal. The main difference between these two types is in nominal data we can't assign ranks while in ordinal data we can assign ranks. Examples, gender of students is nominal data while grades of students is ordinal data"

    "1. Nominal scale data: It is both quantitative and qualitative data in which order does not matter. Example, gender or marital status.\n",
    "2. Ordinal scale data: In this, ranking and order matters but the difference between the values or variables cannot be measured. Example, customer satisfaction rating(extremely dissatisfied, dissatisfied, satisfied, extremely satisfied)\n",

    "4. Ratio scale data: In this, ranking and order matters and difference between data and the ratio can be measured. It can start with zero. Example, Age of people."
