    "<br>Ans: The different types of clustering algorithms are Kmeans clustering, hierarichal clustering and DBSCAN clustering.\n",
    "- Kmeans algorithm partitions the data into fixed number of clusters, each with a central point called a centroid. The goal is to minimize the distance between each point and its assigned cluster centroid.\n",
    "- Heirarchical clustering creates hierarchy of clusters where each cluster is either a leaf node or a parent node of two or more other clusters. The goal is to identify the level of hierarchy that best represents the natural clustering of the data.\n",
    "- DBSCAN algorithm groups data points together based on their local density. The goal is to identify dense region of data points which are assumed to represent clusters."

    "1. Simplicity: K-means clustering is a simple and easy to understand algorithm.\n",
    "2. Efficiency: K-means clustering is a very efficient algorithm, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "3. Robustness: K-means clustering is robust to noise and outliers in the data.\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- Sensitivity to initialization: The results of k-means clustering are sensitive to the initialization of the cluster centroids. If the initial centroids are not well paced, the algorithm may converge to a local minimum, which is not the optimal solution.\n",
    "- Assumptionof spherical clusters: K-means clustering assumes that the data is distributed in a spherical shape around the cluster centroids."

    "2. Silhouette coefficient: This metric measures the similarity of each data point to its assigned cluster and the dissimilarity of each data point to other clusters. The silhouette coefficient can be used to evaluate te quality of a clustering solution for a given value of k. The optimal number of clusters is typically chosen to be the value of k that maximizes the silhouette coefficient."

    "- Preprocess the data to handle categorical data and outliers: There are a number of different ways to preprocess categorical data and outlier. For example, categorical data can be converted to numerical data using one-hot encoding or label encoding. Outliers can be identifies and removed using statistical methods or machine learning algorithms."
