    "Q1. What is boosting in machine learning?\n",
    "<br>Ans: Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Weak learners are models that are slightly better than random guessing. By combining weak learners, boosting can create a model that is much more accurate than any of the individual weak learners."

    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Robust noise:Boosting is robust to noise in the data. this means that it can still perform well even if the data contains errors.\n",
    "- Effective for imbalanced data: Boosting can be effective for tasks such where the data is imbalanced. This means that there are some data points in one class than in the other classes.\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Can be computationally expensive: Boosting can be computaionally expensive, epecislly for large datasets.\n",
    "- Can be sensitive to hyperparameters: The performance of boosting models can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters."

    "Q3. Explain how boosting works.\n",
    "<br>Ans: There are many boosting algorithms, but thay all work in a similat way. First, a weak learner is trained on the data. Then, the predictions of the weak learner are used to adjust the weights of the training data. The data points that are misclassified by the weak learner are given more weight, while the data points that are classified correctly are given less weight. This process is repeated multiple times, with a new weak learner being trained each time. The final model is created by combining the predictions of all of the weak learners."
