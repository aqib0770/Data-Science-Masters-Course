    "<br>Ans. Supervised learning is the method of training a model with some input and output data. There are two types of supervised learning: 1. Classification learning and regression learning. In classification supervised learning, the output is categorical and in regression supervised learning, the output is continuous."

    "<br>Ans. Unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for anomaly detection because it does not require labelled data. Anomalies can be detected by forming the clusters and if any instance doesn't match to any cluster, then it is an outlier or anomaly"
