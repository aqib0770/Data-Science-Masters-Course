    "<br>Ans: Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared. It takes number of independent features in the account also. The main difference between both the methods is r-squared will increase if we add more independent features in it even if they are less related to output feature. Whereas in adjusted r-squared, it will only increase if we add the features which are significantly related with output feature. Its value will always be less than r-squared."

    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "<br>Ans: It is more appropriate when you are comparing models with different number of independent variables. It is because when we add features which are not much related or do not improve the fit, then adjusted R-squared value dosen't increase. This will give more accurate results in terms of fit of the models."

    "<br>For example, let's say we have a linear regression model which helps in predicting the price of the house based on its size. If the model is not regularized, it may learn to fit the training data properly, even if the training data contains some outliers. This would cause the model to overfit and it would not be able to generalize well to the new data."

    "<br>Ans: Regulaized linear models are a powerful tool to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, but they have some limitations:\n",
    "- **They can reduce the model's accuracy:** When a regularized linear model is shrunk too much, it can loose some of its predictive power because it is forced to fit the training data less closely.\n",
    "- **They can be computationall expensive:** The process of regularizing the linear model can be computationall expensive, especially for large datasets. This is because the model has to optimized multiple times, each time with a different value of regularizing parameter.\n",
    "- **They can be difficult to interpret:** The coefficients of regularized linear are often shrunk toward zero, which can make it difficult to intrepret the model. This is because the coefficients represents the inportance of each feature and if they all are shrunk towards zero, it will be difficult to identify the important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, the regularized linear models may not be the best choice for regression analysis. If accuracy is a concern, they regularized model may not be the best choice but if overfitting is a concern, then they are the good choice."
