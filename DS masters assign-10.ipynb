    "2. Cost effective: By using multiple threads, a program can achieve better performance at a lower cost as compared to using multiple processors.\n",
    "3. Reduced latency: By using multiple threads, the latency of the program can be reduced as the threads can be scheduled for execution in parallel. This can result in improved response time for user requests.\n",
